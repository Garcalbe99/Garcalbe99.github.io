        <h1>Alberto's Blog on CAT Equipment</h1>
        <p class="font">When a customer rents equipment from <strong>The Cat Rental Store</strong>, I'm one of the first people to touch the machine when it comes back from rental. I check all of the functions and make sure the machine itself is clean (or at least somewhat clean) and cleared of all debris. I've woorking here for about 8 months and this is what I know so far...</p>

        <h2 id="Ex">Excavator</h2>
        <h6>April 15, 2022</h6>
        <p class="font">These small or big machines vary from size. I work on the standard type of excavators with tracks on them which help gain more traction going up or down different types of terrain. In addition to digging, excavators are commonly used for projects such as demolition, dredging rivers, material handling, or just simply heavy lifting of objects. With such a wide range of uses, it makes sense that there are different types of excavators to help find exactly the right one needed for the job at hand.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Skid">Skid Steer</h2>
        <h6>April 17, 2022</h6>
        <p class="font">A skid-steer loader, or skid steer for short, is a small construction vehicle used for a variety of tasks. Skid steers typically include a bucket as the default attachment, but you can outfit them with many different attachments, allowing skid steers to assist with all sorts of construction and landscaping projects. he skid steer gets its name from the way it turns. The angle of the wheels or tracks is fixed, so they will only point straight ahead. The wheels or tracks on each side of the vehicle are locked in synchronization with each other and have their own engines. This means you have to steer each side independently from the opposite side. Because the wheels are fixed, you cannot steer by angling the wheels in a different direction. Instead, you steer by speeding up either the left or right side of the vehicle, causing the wheels to drag — or skid — across the ground as the skid steer turns.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Sci">Scissor Lift</h2>
        <h6>April 19, 2022</h6>
        <p class="font">A scissor lift is a machine made to move personnel and equipment in a vertical direction. These lifts can handle any application that would normally require a ladder, tower or scaffolding. What truly makes the scissor lift a valuable tool is that it can extend up and then collapse small enough to be easily stored, a value piece that made it a true rival to the traditional ladder. Scissor lifts are available powered by an electric or diesel engine. Electric engines are better for indoor use because they do not require the same level of ventilation as a gas engine and indoor jobs are usually less intense meaning that the battery will also last longer.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Skip">Skip Loader</h2>
        <h6>April 20, 2020</h6>
        <p class="font">A skip loader is a small front end loader used to assist with landscaping, utility, and loading applications. It has a front-mounted bucket controlled by arms from behind the loader and a rear-mounted box scraper. Rear attachments such as snow blowers, mowers, brooms, and forks can make the skip loader more versatile. The loader assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted. Often the bucket can be replaced with other devices or tools—for example, many can mount forks to lift heavy pallets or shipping containers, and a hydraulically opening "clamshell" bucket allows a loader to act as a light dozer or scraper. The bucket can also be augmented with devices like a bale grappler for handling large bales of hay or straw.</p>
